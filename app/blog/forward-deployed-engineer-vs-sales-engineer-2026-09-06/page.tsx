      <h1>Forward Deployed Engineer vs Sales Engineer: Which One Do You Hire?</h1>
      <p className="op-lede">
        A sales engineer is paid to win the deal. A forward deployed engineer is
        paid to make the thing you sold actually run. The line between them is
        the signature, and almost every argument I hear about these two titles
        is really an argument about which side of that signature your company is
        currently bleeding on. If prospects go quiet during the evaluation, hire
        the sales engineer. If they sign and then nothing goes live, hire the
        forward deployed engineer, and stop calling it a sales problem.

      <h2>One of these jobs is in the national statistics. The other is two years old.</h2>
      <p>
        Before comparing them it is worth noticing how differently the two
        titles sit in the world, because that asymmetry explains most of the
        confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sales engineer is a settled American occupation. It has its own code
        in the federal classification, 41-9031, and the official definition
        opens with a verb that ends the argument: sell business goods or
        services, the selling of which requires a technical background
        equivalent to a baccalaureate degree in engineering. Not support the
        sale. Sell. The Bureau of Labor Statistics counted 51,790 of them
        working in the United States as of May 2025, at a median wage of
        $124,900, a mean of $130,140 and $195,270 at the 90th percentile. That
        is a mature profession with a measured population and a known price.
      </p>
      <p>
        The forward deployed engineer has none of that. Search the same federal
        occupation database for the phrase and it returns no title match at all,
        just fuzzy keyword hits into military occupation codes, which is where
        the words forward deployed came from in the first place. Nor has it
        reached the audited page. Search every annual report ever filed with the
        Securities and Exchange Commission and sales engineers appears in 1,582
        Form 10-K filings. Solutions engineers appears in 39. Forward deployed
        engineers appears in 11.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eleven. So when someone tells you these are the same job under different
        branding, remember that one of them has been counted by the government
        for decades and the other has been named in eleven annual reports in
        history. They are not competing definitions of one role. One is an
        institution and the other is a two year old answer to a problem the
        institution does not solve.
      </p>

      <h2>One employer, one city, two postings</h2>
      <p>
        Cross company comparisons are useless here because they mostly measure
        how rich the employer is. So hold the employer constant. Datadog was
        advertising 441 open roles this week. Forty five of those titles contain
        sales engineer. Two contain forward deployed. Both of the interesting
        ones are in New York.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Senior Sales Engineer role covering the East majors carries a base
        band of $149,000 to $198,000 plus variable compensation. Its first
        listed responsibility is to own the sales process in partnership with
        Account Executives by leading and shaping the technical strategy across
        opportunities from PG to Closed Won. Its second is full ownership of the
        technical evaluations end to end, scoping use cases, defining
        competitive success criteria, building a project plan. Then discovery,
        demos, workshops, and identifying and cultivating technical champions
        across multi stakeholder environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Read that list again and notice that every single item stops at Closed
        Won. That is not a criticism. It is the job, and it is a demanding one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Senior Forward Deployed Engineer role, same company, same city,
        carries a base band of $192,000 to $240,000. Its first responsibility is
        to serve as the hands-on technical partner for strategic customers
        implementing Datadog Feature Flags, from pre-sales technical validation
        through post-sales delivery. Then: build prototype flag implementations
        directly in customer codebases. Then: drive full flag migrations to
        completion, including legacy system cutover, efficiently and with
        minimal customer engineering burden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Legacy system cutover. Nobody writes that sentence about a demo. The
        forward deployed engineer is the one still in the building when the old
        system gets switched off, which is the moment every deployment either
        becomes real or quietly does not.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gap between those two base bands is $43,000 at the bottom and
        $42,000 at the top. But the base bands understate the sales engineer,
        whose pay is deliberately part variable, and understate the forward
        deployed engineer differently, because one sales engineer serves a
        territory of deals while a forward deployed engineer serves one account,
        sometimes two.
      </p>

      <h2>The companies that only hire one of them</h2>
      <p>
        The ratios at companies that have picked a side are more instructive
        than any definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Palantir, which invented this job, had 310 open positions this week.
        Seventy seven of them carry forward deployed in the title, 21 in
        Washington, 16 in New York and 12 in London. Roles with sales engineer,
        solutions engineer or pre-sales in the title: zero. Exactly one open
        title contains the word sales at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anthropic had 593 open roles and also lists nothing called a sales
        engineer. It has a Forward Deployed Engineer role covering New York
        City, San Francisco and Seattle at $280,000 to $320,000, asking for four
        or more years in a technical customer facing role and roughly 25 percent
        travel, whose first duty is to work within customer systems to build
        production applications with Claude models. Its pre-sales seat exists,
        but it is called Applied AI Architect, pays $240,000 to $315,000 in San
        Francisco and New York City, and is described as a trusted technical
        advisor helping customers understand the value of Claude, partnering
        with account executives. Advisor and builder, forty thousand dollars
        apart at the top of the band, sitting in the same building.
      </p>
      <p>
        Databricks shows the other shape. Eight hundred and sixty open roles, 95
        with forward deployed in the title, and 195 with solutions engineer or
        solutions architect. It runs both motions at scale, and there is exactly
        one pre-sales engineering manager posting, in London.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pattern is not about company size or fashion. It is about how much
        work sits between a customer saying yes and the customer getting value.
        Where that gap is small, you staff the sale. Where the gap is a quarter
        of integration against a schema nobody documented, no quantity of sales
        engineering closes it, and the companies that learned this the hard way
        stopped hiring for it.
      </p>

      <h2>Read it as a chief financial officer and the line moves</h2>
      <p>
        Twenty years running finance inside high growth companies, through three
        exits, taught me to ignore the org chart on questions like this and look
        at which budget the person comes out of.
      </p>
      <p>
        A sales engineer is a cost of winning revenue. Part of the pay is
        variable and tied to whether deals close, which is exactly right,
        because that is the outcome you want the person optimising. A forward
        deployed engineer is a cost of delivering revenue. The bands I read this
        week are base salary with production outcomes attached and no bookings
        number anywhere in the description.
      </p>
      <p>
        That difference is not administrative. It decides which way a person
        leans in the one meeting that matters, the meeting where the customer
        turns out to need something smaller, duller and less impressive than
        what was sold. A quota carrier is structurally encouraged to keep the
        larger version alive. Someone paid on whether it runs will tell you to
        cut it. If your last three deployments failed because the scope was
        never renegotiated after contact with reality, you did not have a
        talent problem. You had a compensation design problem, and you can fix
        that in a week.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other CFO number here is coverage. One sales engineer supports a
        territory of many simultaneous deals. One forward deployed engineer
        covers one account. On a cost per account basis the forward deployed
        engineer is not 29 percent more expensive than the sales engineer. They
        are several times more expensive, and worth it precisely when the
        alternative is signed revenue that never goes live and never renews.
      </p>

      <h2>Where the sales engineer wins</h2>
      <p>
        Plainly, and more often than the current enthusiasm for forward
        deployment admits.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your deals are dying before the signature, the sales engineer is the
        correct hire and the forward deployed engineer is an expensive person
        with nothing to deploy. A company that cannot get to yes does not have a
        delivery problem yet. Buying delivery capacity to fix a conversion
        problem is one of the more costly ways to be early.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sales engineer also scales in a way the forward deployed engineer
        never will. One good one carries a territory. Demo craft, competitive
        proof of value design, champion cultivation: these are real disciplines
        with decades of practice behind them, and the federal statistics
        confirm there are more than fifty thousand people who do this for a
        living in the United States. That is a deep, priced, hireable market.
        Forward deployed engineering is not. Job listings for it grew around 800
        percent between January and September 2025 and more than 1,000 percent
        year on year into early 2026, which means the title is doing very
        different jobs at different companies and you will spend real effort
        working out what a given candidate actually did.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if your product installs itself, you never need a forward deployed
        engineer at all. Plenty of excellent software is in that position. The
        honest test is whether your average customer is live and using the
        product within two weeks of signing without anyone from your side
        writing code. If yes, staff the sale and stop reading.
      </p>

      <h2>Where the forward deployed engineer wins</h2>
      <p>
        When the money stops after the signature rather than before it. This is
        the failure I get called into, and from the inside it never looks like
        an engineering problem. It looks like a closed deal that has gone quiet.
        The sales engineer did superb work. The proof of value was flawless. The
        contract is signed. Six weeks later nothing is in production, and the
        person who understood the technical picture best has moved on to the
        next opportunity, because that is what their compensation tells them to
        do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Companies with the best products in the world reached this conclusion
        with their own balance sheets. In May 2026 OpenAI launched a four
        billion dollar deployment subsidiary. In July 2026 Anthropic launched
        Ode with Anthropic, built on its acquisition of Fractional AI and backed
        by Blackstone and Hellman and Friedman. Google Cloud is hiring 59
        forward deployed engineers this year. None of those organisations is
        short of sales engineering. They discovered that a superb technical
        evaluation does not install a model into an insurance company's claims
        process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Teradata put the same thought into its annual report for the year ended
        December 2025, filed in February 2026: its AI services consultants and
        its forward-deployed engineers work with customers to assist in their
        transition from concept to production in their AI deployments. Concept
        to production. That transition is the entire job, and it happens
        entirely on the far side of the signature.
      </p>

      <h2>The mistake I see most</h2>
      <p>
        Promoting the sales engineer into the deployment and calling it
        continuity. It is well intentioned every time. They know the account,
        the customer trusts them, and it looks like the cheapest possible
        answer. What actually happens is that the person keeps their quota,
        keeps their territory, and now owes two masters, one of whom pays them.
        Deployment loses. Not because they are lazy or dishonest, but because
        you asked them to choose between this quarter's number and next
        quarter's launch and then told them which one their bonus depends on.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a quieter mistake underneath it. Title inflation runs in both
        directions now that forward deployed engineer has become the fashionable
        phrase. I have seen pre-sales teams renamed wholesale, and I have seen
        genuine deployment engineers buried under a sales engineering title
        because that was the requisition the company already had approved. When
        I read a job description, mine or anyone else's, I ignore the title and
        look for two sentences. Does this person get write access to a system
        they do not own? And are they still accountable for it after the invoice
        is paid? Two yeses is forward deployment whatever it says at the top.
        Anything less is sales engineering, and it should be priced, measured
        and compensated as sales engineering.

      <h2>One question that settles it in a meeting</h2>
      <p>
        Take your last ten deals and put each one in a column. Lost before
        signature. Or signed, then stalled.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the first column is longer, you need a sales engineer and you needed
        one last year. If the second column is longer, you need a forward
        deployed engineer, and every month you spend improving your demo is a
        month spent sharpening a knife you already own. Most founders can fill
        that table from memory in four minutes, and it settles the argument
        faster than any comparison article, this one included.

        I take the second column. Forward deployed into the company, write
        access to the systems, my name against something that has to run in
        production, and no quota anywhere in the arrangement, which is the
        version I would want if I were the one paying. The promise on{" "}

        For founders in New York and across the United States sitting on this
        exact decision, the useful half hour is not a debate about two job
        descriptions. It is going through your last ten deals and marking each
        one lost or stalled, because that table picks the hire. Book that at{" "}

      <h2>Questions I get asked about this</h2>

      <h3>Is a forward deployed engineer a sales role?</h3>
      <p>
        No, though it sits close enough to sales that companies keep confusing
        the two. The clean test is whether the person carries a number tied to
        bookings. Datadog&apos;s senior sales engineer posting in New York asks
        the person to own the sales process in partnership with account
        executives through to Closed Won, and its pay is a base band plus
        variable compensation. Its senior forward deployed engineer posting in
        New York City lists a base band and asks instead for full flag
        migrations driven to completion, including legacy system cutover. Same
        employer, same city, and only one of them is measured on closing.
      </p>

      <h3>Sales engineer vs forward deployed engineer: which pays more in the United States?</h3>
      <p>
        The forward deployed engineer, at every comparison where you can hold
        the employer constant. At Datadog in New York the senior sales engineer
        base band is $149,000 to $198,000 and the senior forward deployed
        engineer base band is $192,000 to $240,000. At Anthropic the forward
        deployed engineer role covering New York City, San Francisco and Seattle
        lists $280,000 to $320,000, against $240,000 to $315,000 for the
        pre-sales seat it calls Applied AI Architect. Against the wider American
        market the gap is larger: the national median for sales engineers is
        $124,900 and the 90th percentile is $195,270. One caveat that matters.
        Sales engineer pay is deliberately part commission, so base bands
        understate it, and a strong sales engineer in a good year can out-earn
        the band.
      </p>

      <h3>Can a sales engineer become a forward deployed engineer?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, and it is one of the better paths in, because the hard part of
        forward deployment is not the code. It is sitting in a room with people
        who did not ask for you and finding out what is actually true. Sales
        engineers do that every week. Two things have to change. Time horizon,
        because their work ends at the signature and this work begins there,
        which means owning something that breaks at eleven at night. And the
        demo reflex, because everything a sales engineer builds is allowed to be
        a prototype and nothing a forward deployed engineer builds is.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I need a sales engineer or a forward deployed engineer for my startup?</h3>
      <p>
        Look at where your deals stop. If prospects go quiet during the
        evaluation, you have a sales engineering gap. If deals close and then
        the account sits unlaunched for a quarter, you have a deployment gap and
        no amount of demo craft closes it. Most founders below Series A who
        think they need both actually need one senior person willing to do the
        unglamorous half of each. Count your last ten deals and mark each one
        lost before signature or stalled after it. The bigger column is your
        hire.
      </p>

      <h3>Does a forward deployed engineer carry a quota?</h3>
      <p>
        In the postings I read this week, no. The forward deployed engineer
        roles at Anthropic, Palantir and Datadog list base salary bands and
        describe production outcomes rather than bookings targets. The sales
        engineer roles describe technical evaluations, champion cultivation and
        closing, and their pay includes variable compensation. That difference
        matters more than the titles, because a quota decides which way a person
        leans when the customer&apos;s real problem turns out to be smaller and
        duller than the one that was sold.
      </p>

      <h3>Where do these numbers come from?</h3>
      <p>
        Every figure above was read on 6 September 2026 from the source itself
        rather than from a summary. The sales engineer occupation definition and
        the absence of any equivalent entry for forward deployed engineer come
        from O*NET OnLine, the United States Department of Labor occupational
        database, code 41-9031. The employment count and wage percentiles come
        from the Bureau of Labor Statistics Occupational Employment and Wage
        Statistics programme, national figures for May 2025, pulled from its
        public data API. The filing counts and the Teradata sentence come from
        the Securities and Exchange Commission full text search across Form 10-K
        filings. The open role counts and every salary band come from the live
        careers feeds at Palantir, Anthropic, Databricks and Datadog. The growth
        figures for forward deployed engineer hiring, and the notes on
        OpenAI&apos;s deployment subsidiary, Ode with Anthropic and Google
        Cloud, come from reporting by Pragmatic Engineer, Perspective AI and
        Paraform. Job boards move. If you are reading this months later the
        bands will have shifted, and the ratios are the part worth keeping.
