He is a CFO turned forward deployed engineer: he builds AI operations inside companies himself rather than writing a report about them, connecting the systems that do not talk to each other and putting real time dashboards in front of chief executives. He also works on intellectual property and data asset valuation and monetisation, and sits beside the founder from the first conversation to the wire transfer on an exit. He is available now for fractional CFO and AI operations work through Beyond Elevation."

      <h1>Forward Deployed Engineer vs Technical Account Manager</h1>

      <p className="op-lede">A forward deployed engineer builds inside one customer&apos;s systems until the product works there. A technical account manager owns that customer&apos;s technical relationship for years after the contract is signed, and sends for the engineer when something needs building. At the 11 companies hiring both titles this morning, 16 of 33 forward deployed postings talk about writing or shipping code. 2 of 34 technical account manager postings do, and both say you won&apos;t.</p>

      <p>I&apos;m Hayat Amin. I spent twenty years as a technology chief financial officer, sold three companies in that seat, and now do forward deployed work myself inside other people&apos;s systems. On 7 October 2026 I pulled 18,231 live postings from 110 employers&apos; own job feeds and read both titles side by side, at the same companies, mostly in the same American cities. Below are the 7 pairs that are fair to compare, what each seat is good for, and who each is wrong for.</p>

      <h2>Why I compared them at the same company</h2>

      <p>Google completes forward deployed engineer vs technical account manager as its own first suggestion, and none of the comparisons I&apos;ve written so far answers it. My demand scan flags it as a rising comparison, and it&apos;s the one an operator meets on the buying side, when a vendor puts both seats on the same account.</p>

      <p>Comparing the two titles across the whole market doesn&apos;t help, because the employers carrying most of the forward deployed postings don&apos;t hire technical account managers at all. Of the 110 employers, 42 had at least one forward deployed engineering posting, 305 in all. 19 had at least one technical account manager posting, 63 in all. 11 had both: Cloudflare, Datadog, Figma, Legora, MongoDB, n8n, Okta, Snowflake, Stripe, UiPath and Vercel. Same company, same product, same pay philosophy. What&apos;s left over is the job.</p>

      <h2>What the 67 postings at those 11 companies say</h2>

      <p>33 are forward deployed engineering roles and 34 are technical account manager roles, excluding managers, directors and new grad programmes. I counted words in every one.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Writing or shipping code: 16 of 33 against 2 of 34. The 2 are Vercel&apos;s technical account manager postings, which say you will not write production code.</li>
        <li>The word production: 23 of 33 against 7 of 34. Prototypes or proofs of concept: 17 against 8.</li>
        <li>Embed: 20 of 33 against 4 of 34. Reusable or playbook: 18 against 4.</li>
        <li>Renewals: 0 of 33 against 8 of 34. Expansion or upsell: 2 against 13.</li>
        <li>Escalations: 4 of 33 against 21 of 34. Account, customer or platform health: 0 against 13. Business reviews: 1 against 8.</li>
        <li>Relationship: 11 of 33 against 27 of 34. Trusted advisor: 9 against 16.</li>
        <li>Travel: 19 of 33 against 14 of 34. Python: 11 of 33 against 17 of 34. TypeScript: 11 against 2.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Two of those surprised me. Technical account managers mention Python more often, because their postings list it as a scripting skill next to Bash or Chef. And they travel. Datadog&apos;s asks for up to 30 percent, more than its own forward deployed engineer at 20. So the difference isn&apos;t who is technical or who gets on a plane. The forward deployed engineer is measured on a go live date and leaves behind something reusable. The technical account manager is measured on the second year of the contract, and the vocabulary is renewals, escalations and health checks. I covered the engineer&apos;s week in <Link href="/blog/do-forward-deployed-engineers-code-2026-09-16/">do forward deployed engineers code</Link> and <Link href="/blog/do-forward-deployed-engineers-travel-2026-09-17/">do forward deployed engineers travel</Link>.</p>

      <h2>The 7 companies hiring both, side by side</h2>

      <p>I&apos;ve ordered them by the top of the forward deployed posting&apos;s published US base band, highest first, with n8n last because it publishes no band for either. Every number was read on the employer&apos;s own posting this morning. A band is a range across levels, not an offer. Okta publishes on target earnings for its technical account managers and base for its forward deployed engineer, which I flag where it matters.</p>

      <h3>1. Figma: Forward Deployed Engineer vs Technical Account Manager</h3>

      <p>Both can be held from San Francisco, New York or remotely in the United States, and both ask for 5 or more years. The forward deployed engineer is $153,000 to $376,000 and the technical account manager is $140,000 to $296,000. Figma is building a founding forward deployed team and says plainly that the role sits in Product and Engineering, not a sales or services function. You make a customer&apos;s design system agent ready, wire up Code Connect, run evals and often write Figma product code. The technical account manager guides enterprise API usage, identity and governance, runs workshops, and surfaces insights that support renewals and expansion.</p>

      <p>The $80,000 gap between the ceilings is my subtraction. Pick the forward deployed side if you&apos;d rather fix a customer&apos;s CI than present to it. Wrong for you if you want one set of accounts for years, because the posting tells you to turn what you learn into a reusable path instead of taking permanent ownership of the customer&apos;s codebase.</p>

      <h3>2. Snowflake: Senior Forward Deployed Engineer, Spark vs Technical Account Manager, Observe</h3>

      <p>The forward deployed engineer is in Menlo Park at $200,000 to $287,500 with equity, travel up to 20 percent, and the job is modernising customers&apos; Spark and data engineering workloads onto Snowflake in Python, Go, Java or C++. The technical account manager is in New York at $148,000 to $194,200 for Observe, Snowflake&apos;s observability product, and asks for 7 or more years in site reliability, DevOps or observability work. Snowflake also lists a Staff Applied AI Engineer (FDE) in Menlo Park at $200,000 to $270,000 with at least 25 percent onsite and a team of engineers to lead.</p>

      <p>This is a hands on technical account manager. You optimise customers&apos; datasets, queries, dashboards and alerts, lead health checks and architecture reviews, and identify expansion opportunities. Pick it if you&apos;ve run production observability and want to stay with the same customers. Wrong for you if you want to build data pipelines from scratch, which is the forward deployed job.</p>

      <h3>3. Okta: Senior Forward Deployed Engineer, Okta for AI Agents vs Technical Account Manager</h3>

      <p>The forward deployed engineer is $200,000 to $275,000 base, 7 or more years, travel 35 percent. The technical account manager on the West Coast is $128,000 to $160,000 on target earnings, which includes incentive pay, and 5 or more years with 3 as a technical account manager or similar. Okta&apos;s senior technical account manager for Auth0 key accounts is $160,000 to $220,000 on target earnings and 8 or more years. All three bands are for the same list of states.</p>

      <p>This is the cleanest split I read. The forward deployed engineer embeds inside four to five strategic customers, sits in their standups and incident response, writes production code in their environment, and briefs the CISO and CIO. The technical account manager builds lightweight proofs of concept in Postman and test tenants and runs workshops, and Okta&apos;s strategic accounts version, at the same $128,000 to $160,000, partners with Customer Success Managers and Account Executives to find expansion opportunities. Even comparing the engineer&apos;s base with the account manager&apos;s on target earnings, the engineer&apos;s floor is $40,000 above the account manager&apos;s ceiling, my subtraction. Wrong for the forward deployed side if you&apos;ve never been on call, because the posting asks for it.</p>

      <h3>4. Cloudflare: Forward Deployed Engineer vs Technical Account Manager</h3>

      <p>The forward deployed engineer is $184,000 to $253,000 for New York and New Jersey hires, with Austin, Dallas and Atlanta also listed, and 10 or more years of technical customer facing experience. Cloudflare&apos;s Senior Forward Deployed Engineer in San Francisco is $194,000 to $266,000 and 7 or more years. The technical account manager is in Washington DC at $99,000 to $136,000, with at least 8 years, travel up to 25 percent and one weekend every quarter.</p>

      <p>The cities differ, so I haven&apos;t subtracted one band from the other. The job descriptions carry the difference. Cloudflare&apos;s forward deployed engineer is embedded with one strategic customer, architects multi stage migrations in Terraform, and stays on the account after migration. Its technical account manager sits in the Customer Support team, owns escalations and ticket times, and delivers quarterly support reviews covering SLA adherence and top ticket drivers. Pick the technical account manager seat if you know BGP and want to own the escalation rather than the build. Wrong for you if you want to build.</p>

      <h3>5. Datadog: Senior Forward Deployed Engineer, Feature Flags vs Technical Account Manager, East</h3>

      <p>The forward deployed engineer is in New York at $192,000 to $240,000, 5 or more years, travel up to 20 percent. The technical account manager covers Boston and New York at $124,000 to $165,000, travel up to 30 percent. Datadog also lists a Technical Account Manager 2 in Boston and Denver at $101,000 to $134,000.</p>

      <p>Datadog&apos;s forward deployed engineer builds prototype flag implementations inside customer codebases early in the sales cycle and drives full migrations to completion. The posting&apos;s own line is that it&apos;s for someone who wants to write code with customers, not just advise them. The technical account manager advises on adoption in line with pre sales, post sales and the renewal process, and prepares monthly and quarterly business reviews. The forward deployed floor is $27,000 above the account manager&apos;s ceiling, my subtraction. Wrong for the account manager seat if you dislike driving between client sites, because the posting says you may sit up to 4 hours doing it.</p>

      <h3>6. Vercel: Forward-Deployed Engineer vs Senior Technical Account Manager</h3>

      <p>Both are hybrid in San Francisco, New York City or Austin. The forward deployed engineer is $137,000 to $207,000 base, 6 or more years with 2 customer facing. The senior technical account manager is $163,000 to $204,000 and 5 or more years. Vercel is the only pair where the account manager&apos;s floor is higher, by $26,000, my subtraction.</p>

      <p>Vercel&apos;s posting is the best description of the difference I found, because the technical account manager sits inside the forward deployed engineering organisation. It says you will not be on call, you will not write production code, and you will not carry a sales quota. The forward deployed engineer leads Next.js migrations and builds production agents inside customer environments. The account manager runs a weekly call, a monthly business review, a quarterly review and an annual roadmap workshop, and scopes the hands on work, then hands it to a forward deployed engineer. The team&apos;s frame, in the posting&apos;s words: PS delivers outcomes, FDE delivers velocity, TAM delivers continuity. Pick the account manager seat if you want to be the person a VP of Engineering calls. Wrong for you if you want to ship code.</p>

      <h3>7. n8n: Forward Deployed Engineer, US East Coast vs Technical Account Manager (US)</h3>

      <p>The forward deployed engineer is in Boston and the technical account manager is anywhere in the United States. Neither publishes a band. The forward deployed engineer is n8n&apos;s founding one, embeds on site for focused 5 day deployment engagements, builds workflows, integrations and custom nodes, and travels roughly 30 to 50 percent. The technical account manager takes the technical handoff from Sales Engineering and owns platform health, escalations and high severity support cases for a portfolio of top tier customers.</p>

      <p>n8n&apos;s version has the most overlap, because its technical account manager may contribute lightweight fixes or pull requests. Pick the forward deployed side if you want to arrive with a hypothesis and leave five days later with production workflows in place, which is how the posting puts it. Wrong for you if half your weeks on the road is too many.</p>

      <h3>Four that hire both and didn&apos;t make a fair pair</h3>

      <p>Legora has a Senior or Staff Forward Deployed Engineer in New York at $237,150 to $369,150, the highest band on this page, and its technical account managers are in London and Stockholm with no band. MongoDB has a Senior Forward Deployed Engineer in the United States at $126,000 to $248,000, and its 3 technical account manager postings are in Japan, Bengaluru and Gurugram. Stripe&apos;s forward deployed engineer sits with Privy in New York, its other forward deployed postings are in marketing and in security in Dublin, and its technical account managers are in San Francisco, Sydney, Mexico City and Singapore, so no two are the same seat in the same city. UiPath has a Technical Account Manager for healthcare in Austin at $94,600 to $170,000 with equity and bonus, and its forward deployed engineers are in Bucharest and Manchester.</p>

      <h2>What the pairs agree on</h2>

      <p>In the 6 pairs with US bands, the forward deployed ceiling is higher in all 6 and the floor is higher in 5. At Okta, Cloudflare and Datadog the forward deployed floor sits above the account manager&apos;s ceiling. Where both postings state years, they&apos;re close: equal at Figma, and the forward deployed side asks for 1 or 2 more at Okta, Cloudflare and Vercel. Snowflake&apos;s Spark posting and Datadog&apos;s account manager posting don&apos;t state a number. So the premium isn&apos;t seniority. These companies pay more for the person who writes the code inside the customer&apos;s environment.</p>

      <p>If you&apos;re choosing between them, I&apos;d ask one question. Do you want to be judged by whether one thing went live, or by whether the customer renewed? The forward deployed engineer&apos;s metric is a go live date. The technical account manager&apos;s is the second year of the contract. At Vercel those are two seats in the same team and the account manager decides when to send for the engineer. I compared the engineer with the role that comes before the deal in <Link href="/blog/forward-deployed-engineer-vs-solutions-engineer-2026-08-29/">forward deployed engineer vs solutions engineer</Link>, and the role itself in <Link href="/blog/what-is-a-forward-deployed-engineer-2026-09-12/">what is a forward deployed engineer</Link>.</p>

      <h2>What this means if you run a company</h2>

      <p>If you run a company of 20 to 500 people, you meet both of these from the buying side. A software vendor sells you the product, a technical account manager is assigned after you sign, and on a big enough contract a forward deployed engineer turns up to make it work. Read the 7 postings above and you&apos;ll know which of the two you&apos;re paying for. One will make sure the product keeps running for you. The other will connect it to your systems.</p>

      <p>What most owners need is the second job without a vendor attached. Somebody sits with your team, learns how the work moves between your finance system, your CRM and your spreadsheets, builds against your live accounts, and stays until it runs. That&apos;s what I do through Beyond Elevation, on a fixed scope, inside your own systems with your own credentials, set out at <a href="https://meethayat.com/services/fde" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">meethayat.com/services/fde</a>.</p>

      <h2>About Hayat Amin</h2>

      <p>I&apos;m Hayat Amin, and I have spent twenty years in technology, most of them as a chief financial officer in companies growing faster than their systems could carry. I sold three of them in that seat, with American Express and TripAdvisor among the buyers, and carried three FT 100 fastest growing listings along the way. I read job postings the way I read a cap table: the band and the years asked for tell you what a company thinks a job is worth.</p>

      <p>I&apos;m exceptional at the forward deployed half of this comparison, because I do it from the finance side. I connect the systems in a company that were never built to talk to each other, I turn what comes out of them into a live number a chief executive can run the week on instead of a month end pack, and I value and monetise the intellectual property and data a company already owns. I also sit beside founders from the first conversation to the wire transfer on an exit. A chief financial officer who builds the integration himself is a rarer pair than either half.</p>

      <p>I&apos;m available now for fractional chief financial officer work and AI operations work through <a href="https://beyondelevation.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beyond Elevation</a>.</p>

      <h2>Questions people actually ask</h2>

      <h3>Forward deployed engineer vs technical account manager: what is the difference?</h3>

      <p>A forward deployed engineer builds inside one customer&apos;s systems until the product works there. A technical account manager owns that customer&apos;s technical relationship after the contract is signed, often for years, and calls in engineers when something needs building. At the 11 companies hiring both titles on 7 October 2026, 16 of 33 forward deployed postings talk about writing or shipping code against 2 of 34 technical account manager postings, and both of those are Vercel&apos;s saying you won&apos;t. 0 of 33 forward deployed postings mention renewals, against 8 of 34.</p>

      <h3>What is the role of a technical account manager?</h3>

      <p>The postings I read describe a named, post sale technical owner for a portfolio of large customers. Datadog&apos;s runs monthly and quarterly business reviews and advises in line with the renewal process. Cloudflare&apos;s owns the support experience, escalations and quarterly support reviews. Vercel&apos;s takes over the technical relationship from the solutions architect at deal close and holds it for the life of the engagement.</p>

      <h3>Technical account manager vs solutions engineer: what is the difference?</h3>

      <p>The solutions engineer or architect wins the deal and the technical account manager keeps it running afterwards. Vercel&apos;s posting says the TAM takes over the post sales technical relationship from the Solutions Architect through a structured handover, and n8n&apos;s says the TAM leads the technical handoff from Sales Engineering.</p>

      <h3>Technical account manager vs customer success manager: what is the difference?</h3>

      <p>In the postings I read, they sit side by side on the same account. Okta&apos;s technical account manager partners with Customer Success Managers and Account Executives, and Vercel&apos;s splits the account so the TAM owns technical and the Account Executive owns commercial, each with veto rights in their own domain. The technical account manager is the one expected to read the customer&apos;s architecture.</p>

      <h3>What is a technical account manager salary?</h3>

      <p>At the 11 companies hiring both titles on 7 October 2026, the US bands run from $94,600 at the bottom of UiPath&apos;s Austin posting to $296,000 at the top of Figma&apos;s, with Cloudflare&apos;s Washington DC posting at $99,000 to $136,000. Datadog&apos;s East posting is $124,000 to $165,000, Snowflake&apos;s in New York is $148,000 to $194,200 and Vercel&apos;s senior one is $163,000 to $204,000 in San Francisco. Okta publishes on target earnings rather than base, $128,000 to $160,000.</p>

      <h3>Do forward deployed engineers get paid more than technical account managers?</h3>

      <p>Yes at the same company, in 5 of the 6 pairs with published US bands. The forward deployed ceiling is higher in all 6, and at Okta, Cloudflare and Datadog the forward deployed floor sits above the technical account manager&apos;s ceiling. Vercel is the exception, where the senior technical account manager&apos;s floor of $163,000 is $26,000 above the forward deployed engineer&apos;s $137,000, my subtraction.</p>

      <h2>Where these numbers come from</h2>

      <p>Every count comes from the employers&apos; own job feeds, the ones their applicant tracking systems publish on Greenhouse, Ashby and Lever, read on 7 October 2026. 110 employers returned live postings, 18,231 in all, including Palantir, OpenAI, Anthropic, Databricks, Scale AI, Snowflake, Datadog, Cloudflare, Okta, Figma, Vercel, Stripe, MongoDB, Twilio, Wiz, ClickHouse, n8n, UiPath and Legora. A forward deployed engineering posting is any title with forward deployed or FDE in it, managers, leads, directors, recruiters and interns excluded. A technical account manager posting is any title with technical account manager or TAM in it, and in the 67 I compared I also excluded managers, directors and new grad or analyst programmes. Word counts are plain text matches, so a posting that says travel once counts the same as one that says it ten times. That is a sample of companies hiring in AI and software, not a census, so read the counts as what these employers asked for that morning. The autocomplete phrases were pulled from Google the same morning.</p>
